# panel-truck-2

`panel-truck-2` is a Vue 3 component for creating interactive storylines using images and maps. It's especially useful for libraries and museums that want to create linear narrations on top of one or multiple deep-zoomable objects. Panel Truck 2 supports IIIF, static images, and tiled web map layers as sources.

It is based on [panel-truck](https://github.com/bpImaps/panel-truck), but it was updated to Vue 3 and refactored to use the Composition API. It is also available for install through NPM.

## Installation

```bash
npm install panel-truck-2
```

## Documentation
