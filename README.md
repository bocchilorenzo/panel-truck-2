# panel-truck

`panel-truck` is a web UI tool for creating interactive storylines using images and maps. It's especially useful for libraries and museums that want to create linear narrations on top of one or multiple deep-zoomable objects. Panel Truck supports IIIF, static images, and tiled web map layers as sources. It is trivial to embed into an existing web site, and requires only a simple JSON file to construct a presentation.

## Example

See an [example Panel Truck presentation](https://geoservices.leventhalmap.org/panel-truck/example.html)
